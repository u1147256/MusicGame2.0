In Northern Italy, folk\nmusic draws on more Central European tradition. This region\nis most known for troubadours, traditional Occitanic composers\nthat date back to the middle ages. In Southern Italy, there is a\nstronger Slavic and Greek influence that results in a more choral\nsound. Across Italy, popular instruments include variations on\nthe accordion and bagpipe, along with percussion such as the\ntambourine.");
