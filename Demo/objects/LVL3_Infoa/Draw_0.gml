While many songs are sung in English, some are sung\nin Gaelic, the ancient language of the Celtic people in what is now\nIreland and Scotland. Sometimes Celtic mythology and local\nsuperstitions are incorporated into Irish folk music even into the\nmodern day. The most distinct musical instruments used in Irish\nfolk music are fiddles and flutes, which lends the music its\ndistinctive upbeat tempo.");
